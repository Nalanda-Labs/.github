# Nalanda Labs

At Nalanda Labs we are committed to high-performance web application development
using Rust/Postgres/Svelte. There is no reason why Rust should not be used for
web app development.

We believe that Rust is silver bullet of programming. As soon as WASM frameworks
will mature we will discard even Svelte and make use of one of the WASM frameworks.
